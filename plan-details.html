			In order for Carmela Marie Ryan to have a successful fun-funeral she decided to start planning it early for others to commemorate this event. Although funerals are meant to be a solemn event to remember our loved ones and the memories they have shared with us. However my aunt’s utter refusal to have anyone cry at the time of her passing is one of her strongest wishes she has impressed upon me.

			So to keep the memory of her alive, she will collaborate with me in this “How to plan my aunt’s <em>FUN</em>-funeral!
